# 1. Inspiration
Before you start training, find a good example for what you want your voice to sound like. It's a lot easier to train your voice if you have a specific goal to strive for.
If you can't think off the top of your head, you can try [one of these](/wiki/pages/voice-examples/) 
# 2. Vocal Tract Length
PLEASE don't try to move the muscles manually, this can end up either straining your muscles too much.
Try to change your voice rather than moving the muscles. It should start to come easier as you practice more.

A good drill to start is the [big dog/small dog drill](/wiki/pages/resonance/#big-dog-small-dog)
Heres a good video by freya on youtube

If you do this while lookingin a mirror you may notice your voice box(?) start to move up/down. Yay progress ! :D
# 3. Pitch
## [Pitch is not extremely important!](/wiki/pages/getting-started/pitch#how-important-is-pitch)
#### But it CAN help you train a lot.
It's recommended that you train at around 200hz, and then more around from there onceyour comfortable.
If you cant go that high without falsetto, you can slowly work your way up by starting low and slowly moving up, going a bit higher every time.


Now that youve started on your voice journey, record another clip of your voice using what you've accomplished so far.
