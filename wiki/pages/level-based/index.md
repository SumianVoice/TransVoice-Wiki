# Welcome!
This guide is meant to be formatted similarly to [L's Voice Guide](https://www.troddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/d3clhe/ls_voice_training_guide_level_1_for_mtf) on Reddit, but with more up to date information.
All information on this part of the guide was taken from either the rest of this guide, or from L's guide.


## Getting started
This guide was made by a transfem for help with vocal feminization, if you are transmasc and know some good resources, contribute!
I'll try my best to make the resources neutral, but there are no guarantees
### Stuff to help you along your way
Before you start, record your voice as it is, dont try to change anything yet. Do this before every session if you can.
Whenever you train, keep a bottle of water with you, an drink it often. It's a lot harder to train when you're dehydrated.
