# Vocal Weight
## What is vocal weight?
Vocal weight is a perceived quality of voice. Although it doesn't directly describe a physical modification, it does allude to one.

This is also referred to as:
- OQ/CQ open and closed quotient
- vocal fold mass
- thickness and thinness of the folds
- buzziness

It is essentially a way of describing the sound quality caused by the amount of mass with which the vocal folds interact among other things. Think of it like clapping your hands together. You can vary the speed your hands travel and this causes the sound to increase in volume. You could also tense the muscles in your hands so that when they do hit they have a more sudden and thus louder interaction. But, we can also use either only the tips of your fingers or the whole palm. The vocal folds are doing a similar thing. Since it's one of the most important and fundamental aspects of voice it's super useful to have good control over it.

Normally we might not affect vocal weight consciously at all, but there are ways to induce a change in it. Imagine you're clapping slowly as we described earlier. Now increase the rate with which we clap - as we go faster and faster we can't put as much force into each clap and so the force of each clap is lower. This is similar to the effect of low vocal weight when going to a high pitch. When we go up in pitch, the vocal folds are vibrating with a higher frequency, so of course, it's natural that the vocal weight tends to decrease when going to higher pitches, particularly when we don't try to force it and instead stay relaxed. Similarly, when we go down in pitch, the vocal folds are vibrating slower and so tend to have more mass involved in that vibration. This is the reason why pitch slides are such a great exercise for vocal weight.

It's important however to be aware that pitch is not the only way to affect weight. You can isolate it and get low weight at a low pitch for example or high weight at a high pitch. This extra control is very useful - not only does it prevent us from accidentally slipping into another configuration but it allows us to progress faster and expand our range for this aspect more.


## Warning Against Hyperadduction
[Hyperadduction](/wiki/pages/various/hyperadduction) or pressed phonation can sound similar to vocal weight to a beginner, and so if increasing weight we can accidentally use it instead. Usually this only happens when trying to add weight. Hyperadduction sounds very buzzy, whereas vocal weight is more of _rumble_ quality. Adding more pressure and forcing it through tightly is very bad for the vocal folds.


## Breathiness
[Breathiness](/wiki/pages/clarity/breathiness) can hide the _buzziness_ effect of a high vocal weight voice and make it harder to hear. This is not lowering vocal weight at all, only making the high vocal weight voice softer. It's best to avoid breathiness especially in exercises that modify vocal weight.

If we make a habit of using breathiness to high weight and talking at a high pitch with heavy vocal weight for too long, we can make that comfortable to the point that we cannot use normal techniques like pitch slides to reduce weight.

Using glottal strikes or [medium hard onsets](/wiki/pages/clarity/onsets) and offsets can help avoid this when doing vocal weight exercises.


## Gender perception of vocal weight
* Low vocal weight ➡️ ♀️ more feminine
* High vocal weight ➡️ ♂️ more masculine

There are however, many female voices with medium to heavy vocal weight. Some examples include [imawonder](/wiki/pages/voice-examples/#imawonder) and [39daph](/wiki/pages/voice-examples/#daph). The important thing that makes this possible is most likely [microbehaviours](/wiki/pages/microbehaviours/) and potentially different ways/mechanisms of affecting the perception of vocal weight.

Even though it's possible to have a feminine voice with medium or high vocal weight and even at a low pitch, it's extremely difficult until we have more control.


## Generalisations about vocal weight
These are very much generalisations and might not be accurate in everyone's case. Generally, vocal weight requires more air pressure, but not flow rate.

- When getting louder I drop in pitch and/or don't add air - heavier weight
- When getting louder I raise in pitch and add air - lighter weight


## Loudness vs vocal weight
A lot of people conflate the volume of our speech with vocal weight. Vocal weight is louder, but that doesn't mean all loud things are high in vocal weight. Yelling or shouting (rather than just speaking loudly) typically induces three things:

* raise in pitch
* increased airflow (and increased closure to balance)
* increased vocal weight

These can be isolated or removed from the equation. You can get loud without going up in pitch, or without increasing airflow or any combination. Some people go quiet when trying to achieve low vocal weight and then never learn control over it properly. It's important to 'stretch' in every direction (within reason) and to avoid relying on something for our voice to work!


# Exercises
## The "awww" Trigger
There are some behavioural triggers that encourage light vocal weight. One of these is to say "awww" as if talking to a cute puppy. We can then pitch down to where we can speak more comfortably. We need to make sure the pitch is high enough to get lighter weight (220hz or higher, usually) and low enough that we can actually speak.

After saying "awww" 1-3 times we can go into speaking in that configuration, either a passage or just narrating to ourselves.

This exercise is usually very effective if done at the right pitch and in a relaxed way. Unlike pitch slides we don't have as much of a tendency to keep the weight high accidentally which makes it a very good exercise for if we tend to belt instead of lighten when going to high pitches. 


## Pitch Slides
Pitch slides are a good way to reduce vocal weight. As we go up in pitch, the folds want to thin and vibrate at a higher rate, which decreases the amount of force involved in phonation. You can use pitch then to induce low vocal weight and then eventually learn to control it independently of pitch.

The exercise itself looks like this:

</p>

It can be very useful to bring the low vocal weight configuration down to a low pitch. Usually this is to either get more control over it in general or to access that lower range for low pitch feminine voices.

## Yawning Exercise
Yawning typically induces lower vocal weight so we can sometimes use this to our advantage. Usually people yawn with low vocal weight and low resonance, so we can use this to see what low vocal weight sounds like for us. Some people have a tendency to abduct (go breathy) so it's important to be aware of this and reduce the breathiness if there is any.

1. yawn down to a low pitch
2. reverse the yawn to come back up
3. each time, go down to a higher pitch, working your way up to about 220hz or A3
4. each time, make sure you check that when you go to higher resonance, it doesn't go too heavy

## Using the 'sh' sound to control airflow amount
\[Experimental\] Using the 'sh' sound to control airflow amount and then the 'dj' (like in jam) to go into voiced while still controlling airflow. This can be used to show the difference between heavy and light vocal weight. It isn't recommended for reducing vocal weight but it might be useful for isolating airflow volume vs vocal weight and pressed phonation.

# Other Info
## Vocal Weight and Airflow
Higher vocal weight requires more subglottal pressure, but not more airflow. This can seem a little counter intuitive, but we can increase air pressure without increasing airflow, since that airflow pressure is resisted by the folds. This extra resistance by the folds is what allows them to vibrate with more mass. If the airflow skipped over the folds, then they wouldn't have the energy to move in the high vocal fold mass configuration.
- more vocal weight requires more pressure but not airflow
- you can get louder without increasing airflow by adding vocal weight and pressure
- pressed phonation ([hyperadduction](/wiki/pages/various/hyperadduction)) is another example of adding force to the folds to get a louder sound


## Closure Relationship
Adding more closure, like in yelling (loud at a high pitch) or barking (loud at a low pitch) does not necessarily add weight. Often, we hear more adduction like in [hyperadduction](/wiki/pages/various/hyperadduction) as _heavier_ when it's actually just louder. It's important to be careful not to assume that because a sound is more buzzy or louder, that it is from vocal weight.
