# Pitch Intuitive Practice Methodology
## Things to know
1. your voice should always be quite relaxed; effort is not needed and should be avoided
2. make sure the voice is always improving, don't sacrifice some part of your voice to gain another part
3. focus on the sound, not numbers or feelings - those can only tell you what not to do

## The plan
Start at C3. You can use a virtual piano for this or a tone generator. The idea is to raise that voice up a little and make it brighter and sweeter, one very small step at a time. Each step is relaxed, and should be improving the voice even if very slightly. We should spend at least 5 minutes on each step.
If you're super comfortable at all steps below some note, just start at the last note / step you had consistent success with or wherever feels reliably comfortable. The idea is to apply the pitch you did in the exercise to all of your normal speech as well if possible.

## Stage one
At each step we will speak for a little while and just naturally let the voice adjust to that step. What you say is up to you but narration and rambling organically is best, otherwise reading a script, passage or a book is good, but don't let it become monotonous or "just going through the motions".

We know it's time to go to the next stage when we're totally comfortable speaking at this level.

## Stage two
Now we continue talking but add intonation as well. *Only add intonation when you feel comfortable doing so though*, never do it prematurely. Once comfortable while reading some passage or narrating, just organically add the intonation in however it feels **most natural** to you. Then sometimes come back to the original pitch to make sure you haven't dropped.

Using a phrase like this from Pikat might help, because the **start** of the phrase starts at the **base level** instead of intonating up immediately like a lot of phrases. It only goes up when you get to *"draw"*.
> "When you draw fewer lines, then you know, takes less time."

Once you're **fully** comfortable here and have no issues and have been talking fluidly for at least a few minutes, you can move on to the next stage. 

## Stage three
Now, we pick the next note higher (e.g. from D3 to E3) and hold that, starting stage one over again. 

## Examples
This clip is hidden for now until the methodology is solidified but is the first time it was used. This was quite successful even in its basic form.
