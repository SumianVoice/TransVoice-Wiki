# List of Microbehaviours
These are mostly very vague for now, since not much is known about what is actually happening. There are no terms available that can describe most of these so it won't be like _"vocal weight"_ or _"resonance"_, it will be more like _"that thing that happens that makes voices that are low pitch sound bright and higher in pitch than they actually are"_. This will be added to with more information as time goes on.
## Low pitch brightness
This might not be a microbehaviour and instead just be something as simple as adding twang.

Examples:
- [imawonder](/wiki/pages/voice-examples/#imawonder)
- [39daph](/wiki/pages/voice-examples/#daph)
- [The Narrator (Baldur's Gate)](/wiki/pages/voice-examples/#the-narrator-baldurs-gate) (only sometimes)
- [Drawing With Waffles](/wiki/pages/voice-examples/#drawing-with-waffles) (occasionally)

## High resonance deepness
Deepness is usually associated with either breathiness or low resonance, but in this case it's high resonance, but without being bright.

Examples:
- [Nurse](/wiki/pages/voice-examples/#nurse)
- [The Narrator (Baldur's Gate)](/wiki/pages/voice-examples/#the-narrator-baldurs-gate) (only sometimes)
