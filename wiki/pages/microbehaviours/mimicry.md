# Mimicry
Some parts of the voice are so small and hard to consciously modify that mimicry is the only way we know of.
Mimicry is a good way to learn new microbehaviours, speech patterns and can also eventually modify your voiceprint. It breaks down the barrier of the subconscious wanting to keep the voice confined to what it's used to and allows for new tweaks to happen.

## Getting a clip to mimic
- identify an aspect of voice you want to change or a voice you want to have
- find an example of that voice quality that is at a similar pitch and not too far out of your resonance range
- make sure it's not too fast, or it will be harder to mimic
- get a 2-5 second clip, just a short phrase of about 5-10 words, cut it from the clip and add a beep at the beginning

## Mimicry 101
- the reason mimicry works is that it lets your subconscious figure stuff out intuitively so don't overanalyse
- try to copy all speech patterns - intonation, tempo, resonance drops, volume
- get into the character, expect their voice to come out of your mouth and believe it 100%, don't just hope, believe.
- play the voice in your head before and during your attempt
- do a combination of two methods:
    * dub over the clip as it's playing in real time
    * listen to a clip, and while listening mouth the words but don't speak, then once it's finished try to do your best impression

## Benefits of mimicry
- helps you learn speech patterns
- if you find your self perception is negative, it can help you get a voice that sounds 'less like you'
- helps learn microbehaviours
