# Resonance
## What is Resonance
Every space has resonance frequencies. When a sound passes through that space, frequencies in the sound near the resonance frequencies of the space are highlighted. You can hear a resonance frequency when you blow air across the lip of a bottle. The more water (and thus less air) is in the bottle, the higher the pitch of the whistle sound produced. Your vocal tract is similar to this, though much more complex of course.

Think of the larynx as the level of water in the bottle. The higher the larynx, the higher the resonance. When in voice, an area that is highlighted because of a resonance frequency is called a formant.

## Formants
Formants are areas of the voice that are highlighted because of the shape of the vocal tract. If a resonance is a property of the container, or space, then a formant is a property of the *sound*. There are three formants we really care about.

0. First, and while it isn't a formant itself, F0. F0 is your pitch, and it's the fundamental frequency of your voice at any time.
1. F1 is the lowest formant by frequency
2. F2 is the second lowest formant

All resonances (and so, formants) will be raised by shortening the vocal tract, and lowered by extending it.

When we make different vowels, we move our mouth to change these formants so that the space between them is different, and that's how we can tell what vowel someone is saying. Try saying "hat" and "hoot". Notice one sounds brighter and one darker. In "hoot" we make the mouth longer by pushing the lips out slightly, and so more space and longer tube = lower resonance.

The following two sounds are at the same pitch (fundamental / F0), but at drastically different resonances. Larynx height isn't the only thing changing here, but it has the most impact.

# Types of Resonance Modification
## Larynx Height
Since the larynx houses the vocal folds, moving it up shortens the vocal tract and raises resonance. The sound is created further up the vocal tract.

## Vowel Shape
Vowels change formants. By changing the mouth shape we can access different vowels but also increase or decrease overall resonance by shifting vowels to a higher resonance vowel like /.ae/ as in 'had'.

## OPC and OPE
### OPC - Oropharyngeal closure
The back of the mouth, the palatopharyngeal arch can constrict to become a tighter space, which raises resonance. This can also encourage tongue root retraction which contributes to a cartoonish quality (commonly heard in some anime voices).
### OPE - Oropharyngeal expansion
Likewise, it can be expanded to lower resonance.

## Mouth Space
By changing tension in a few places in the mouth we can achieve a brighter or darker sound. Imagine pulling the corners of the mouth back for an <b class="hlgreen">A</b> vowel like in <b class="hlgreen">HAD</b>, then keep the inward pressure from the cheeks but remove the expression. This when done properly with enough practice causes a fairly significant shift in brightness.

## Twang*
There are many ways to get a _"twangy"_ sound. It can encourage nasality so it's worth being aware of that. Twang adds upper frequency range information which means a brighter sound. It highlights parts of the voice around 2000-4000hz which is in the F2 range. It has a buzzy quality. This can add some brightness to a voice when added in very small amounts, so that we can go from a dark, soft sound to a bright crisp sound. It's especially useful when imitating low pitch bright voices, and getting loudness at medium to high pitch without adding vocal weight.

## Exercises
To raise resonance in general, using a combination of modifications.
### Big Dog Small Dog
1. Imitate a big dog panting
2. Try to imitate a smaller and smaller dog, raising the 'pitch' (it's not actually pitch) of the whisper
3. Make a normal voiced sound (not a whisper) at a set pitch like 200hz or G3 or whatever you like
  - avoid going too high in pitch

Pitfalls:
1. using FVF constriction to get louder breaths
  - make it light and quiet but very airy, don't sacrifice airflow to make it quiet
2. raising pitch as well as resonance
  - since they are usually linked, this is common, and it might be worth using the voiced resonance slides or steps exercise

### Whisper Sirens
These are the same as big dog small dog, but without panting, just a constant stream of air going from low resonance to high or vice versa.

Pitfalls:
1. even more likely to become FVF constricted especially at high resonance

### Voiced Resonance Slide
Related: kyo kya

A voiced resonance slide can be difficult because we'll want to change pitch as well. A reverse yawn can actually be a fairly good way to get an idea of how this happens. If we leave the pitch to do what it wants and then raise the larynx, pitch will raise too, probably by a lot.

With more practice it is possible to change resonance without affecting pitch, and this can be very useful, since we would not need to stop speaking to redrill resonance.

How to learn it is essentially to first do voiced resonance slides, and drag the pitch down without dropping the larynx, and then when some control is achieved, try and try again to move the larynx without moving pitch. Focus on the pitch sound.

### Voiced Resonance Stepping
In this exercise we start at a medium or high pitch, then:
1. speak some words at neutral resonance
2. speak the same words at low resonance
3. speak the same words at high resonance

This helps avoid pitch conflation (going up in pitch when changing resonance) and might be more natural and less constricted for some people.

Pitfalls:
1. changing pitch too much
  - have a pause between each step, don't slide
  - picture the pitch when you speak

### Kyo Kya
This is mostly for learning OPC

Kyo Kya is a voiced resonance exercise where we start with low resonance on "kyo" and repeat the sound while raising the larynx, then when we can't add more larynx height, we go to "kya" and try to add OPC. Listen to OPC sounds in order to get an idea. Mimicking cartoon voices that have OPC in them can be a good way to learn the movement.


## Note on TH and SH Muscles
As a generalisation, when raising the larynx as a result of raising pitch, only the thyrohyoid muscles raise the larynx. Often when training resonance we use both the thyrohyoid muscles and the stylohyoid muscles. The stylohyoid muscles do add some resonance, but it typically isn't as much as from the thyrohyoid muscles.

![tongue and larynx](/img/diagram-tongue.png)
_The stylohyoid runs from top right middle to the hyoid bone, thyrohyoid runs from hyoid to the larynx (thyroid)._

If we have a situation in which the resonance cannot go above around 700hz F1 (/.ae/ vowel) then it's highly likely that only the stylohyoid muscles are being activated. It can be useful then to use high pitch to gain activation of the thyrohyoid muscles and then lower pitch while trying to maintain that configuration.
