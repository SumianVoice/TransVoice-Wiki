# List of Bad Exercises
{: .no_toc }
Below is a very incomplete list of just some of the vocal training methods that are either extremely questionable or downright dangerous. Each is ranked and information about how to avoid the risks if possible is included.

This is an evolving document like most of the site, so we're always looking for more info.

## Risky, dangerous or ineffective exercises

### Swallow and hold
{: .no_toc .d-inline-block }
<div>dangerous</div>{: .label .label-red }

- often used to raise the larynx
- risks extreme constriction of muscles not associated with phonation including [FVF](/wiki/pages/clarity/FVF)
- strain, loss of vocal control, loss of [closure](/wiki/pages/clarity/breathiness), pain can result
- recommended by some very old resources and occasionally SLPs

**To avoid risks**:
- don't do it at all
- swallowing is fine, holding is not. Learning _what_ a larynx _is_ with swallowing is fine, but it is absolutely paramount that you don't hold it and _do not base your understanding of how the larynx can be moved_ on the sensations being felt or muscles used when swallowing.

### Glottal stop slide _or any slide toward full [closure](/wiki/pages/clarity/breathiness)_
{: .no_toc .d-inline-block }
<div>risky</div>{: .label .label-yellow }

- can encourage a conflation between [FVF](/wiki/pages/clarity/FVF) closure and true fold [closure](/wiki/pages/clarity/breathiness)
- very, very hard to untrain if habitualised

**To avoid risks**:
- only do it under supervision of someone who knows what [FVF](/wiki/pages/clarity/FVF) closure glottal stops and strikes sound like
  - don't add more pressure
  - use extremely light [glottal taps](/wiki/pages/clarity/FVF.html#checking-for-fvf-closure-issues) to gain understanding of unconstricted true fold closure
- don't do it
