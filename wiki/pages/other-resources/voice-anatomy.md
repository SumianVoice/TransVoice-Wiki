## Notes:
- The thyroid tilts in order to increase or decrease pitch, by stretching or relaxing the vocal folds.
- **CT**: The cricothyroid muscle tilts the thyroid forward, increasing pitch.
- **TA**: The thyroarytenoid muscles tilts the thyroid backward, decreasing pitch. (also responsible for heavier vocal weight(?))
- The arytenoid muscles adduct (bring together) the vocal folds along with the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles.
- The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles abduct (pull apart) the vocal folds, causing a breathy quality in voice.
- The epiglottis helps encourage food and so on not to pass through the airway (but the vocal folds close as well when swallowing in order to be sure).
- The lateral cricoarytenoid muscles adduct the folds
