# Vocal Mechanisms
A vocal mechanism or register is a distinct configuration of vocal fold interaction. Which, is a complicated way of saying...
- vocal mechanisms are distinct, they don't overlap
- they describe how the vocal folds vibrate
- phonation is always within one of these mechanisms
- you can pass between mechanisms without a break with training

## M0

fry
{: .label .label-blue }
strohbass
{: .label .label-blue }
pulse
{: .label .label-blue }

M0 or vocal fry is at the bottom of your vocal range. Try going to your lowest note, then relax a little and go lower. The rough sound similar to an idling motorcycle engine is from M0. This is when the folds are slack and the whole fold vibrates.
. slack folds
. whole fold vibrates
. below your lowest M1 note

## M1

normal speech
{: .label .label-blue }
modal
{: .label .label-blue }
chest voice
{: .label .label-blue }

M1 is your normal speaking register.
. where most people speak the majority of the time
. most of the vocal folds vibrates

## M2

falsetto
{: .label .label-blue }
mix
{: .label .label-blue }
head voice
{: .label .label-blue }

M2 is a usually hollow, very high pitch register.
. sometimes has a gap between folds / lack of closure
. very high pitch
. usually the TA muscles deactivate except in [strong m2](/wiki/pages/pitch-range/strong-m2) practice
. mostly just mucosa of the folds vibrates

## M3

whistle

flageolet
{: .label .label-blue }
flute register
{: .label .label-blue }

There are different theories and types of M3, but the main one is with mostly complete closure and a lot of tension, such that only a part of the folds vibrates.

This type of M3 is called stop closure whistle by [Antonio Di Corcia and Franco Fussi's paper↗](https://www.francofussi.com/wp-content/uploads/WHISTLE-REGISTER-OF-THE-SINGING-VOICE.-HSDI-EVICENCE.pdf) which puts forward the following findings:

**FLW - Female Laryngeal Whistle**
- _"very thin, stiff and tightly stretched vocal folds"_
- _"Often, no contact between the folds during phonation was noted"_
**SCW – Stop Closure Whistle**
- _"the whistle sound depends on a tiny orifice at the anterior third of the folds"_
- caused by high adduction
- _"HSDI observation showed a total absence of vibration (normal periodic vibration) in any components of the vibrating system caused by the stop_closure phenomenon"_
**IW - Ingressive Whistle**
- _"high activity of the adductor muscles"_
- _"absence of vibrating parts during ingressive phonation"_
**Scream in M3**
- _"[...]very stretched, thin and stiff vocal folds and an high constriction of the false vocal folds"_
- _"[...]very further reduction of the mucosal wave vibration, very restricted to the edge of the fold"_
