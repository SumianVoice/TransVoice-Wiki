# Getting Started

Below is a typical plan assuming a typical masculine voice trained to be feminine. This isn't always accurate because everyone's different but it can give some direction to start. However, before we get into that, let's get some things straight.
- [Pitch is not that important!](pitch) It's useful for training, intonation and a few other things, but it's not a gender factor.
- It's important to be aware at every stage of the possibility of falling into bad habits so keep in mind what can go wrong in each exercise.
- Sometimes, knowing voice anatomy or reading research papers or watching videos about voice pedagogy is useful for background, but if you're reading or theorising more than you're practising, it's not helping!
- Practice doesn't mean doing drills. Good practice is drilling only when needed, then speaking freely. Here's a biased ranking of practice methods
  1. speaking in the presence of voices you want to sound like
  2. just talking in VC or in person
  3. doing a drill and reading a passage
  4. doing SOVTEs

## Lower [weight](/wiki/pages/vocal-weight) and raise pitch
- the recommendation is to start by lowering vocal weight. Getting to a higher pitch with lower weight makes a significant difference already
- avoid [breathiness](/wiki/pages/clarity/breathiness) or going too light, avoid [M2 / falsetto](/wiki/pages/other-resources/mechanisms) for now

## Raise [resonance](/wiki/pages/resonance) as needed
- people often raise their larynx (and thus, resonance) when going to a high pitch, so you might not need to do this step
- avoid [FVF](/wiki/pages/clarity/FVF) constriction (old man / old woman voice)
- when going out of an unvoiced slide, do so fluidly, avoid pauses that can let you reset to a lower larynx position
- clean the sound up before using it. Don't use a configuration that is rough, make it smooth first even at the cost of lowering resonance slightly

## Practice speech patterns and [microbehaviours](/wiki/pages/microbehaviours)
- find an [example](/wiki/pages/voice-examples) of a voice you like
- avoid emphasis with volume for feminine voices
- vary tempo
- intonation doesn't need to be super high, but it's worth practicing

## Clean up the voice
If you're at this stage and you have any roughness in your voice, now's the time to sort it out. Going further will make it extremely difficult to unlearn later

- reduce [breathiness](/wiki/pages/clarity/breathiness)
- practice lighter onsets with glottal strikes
- learn [FVF](/wiki/pages/clarity/FVF) retraction
- identify sources of tension and eliminate them
- find or create your strategically lazy configuration

## Get more [pitch range](/wiki/pages/pitch-range)
- at first this means just using the voice at a higher pitch sometimes to stretch your range. Fatigue is normal, but strain is to be avoided. If tension in neck persists for more than a few seconds after stopping speech, then you should rest and reevaluate your methods
- using [M2 and making it stronger](/wiki/pages/pitch-range/strong-m2) (sometimes called mix voice) is a good quick way to get tons of extra range
- practice intonating progressively higher

## Learn [belting](/wiki/pages/pitch-range/belting) to be able to shout
- know what pressed phonation / hyperaduction sounds like and DON'T DO IT.
- don't just do an ah vowel, do harder ones like eh
- slowly reduce weight at your highest note in order to go even higher (will probably break at first)

## Start [mimicry](/wiki/pages/microbehaviours/mimicry)
- find a clip of a voice that is close to yours such as from [voice examples](/wiki/pages/voice-examples)
- put a beep sound at the beginning for timing
- practice speaking over it as it plays and also listening and copying
