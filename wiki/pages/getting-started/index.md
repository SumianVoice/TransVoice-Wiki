# Getting Started
Before we get into a typical plan for voice feminisation, let's get some things straight.
- [Pitch is not that important!](pitch) Well, it's actually _really important_ but not in the way you might think. It's very useful for training, intonation and a few other things, but it's not a gender factor _in and of itself_.
- It's important to be aware at every stage of the possibility of falling into bad habits so keep in mind what can go wrong in each exercise.
- Sometimes, knowing voice anatomy or reading research papers or watching videos about voice pedagogy is useful for background, but if you're reading or theorising more than you're practising, it's not helping!
- Drills and exercises are for inducing exploration. Exploration is one of the most important parts of voice because most of voice is determined by coordination and habit.
- Practice doesn't mean just doing drills. Good practice is drilling only when needed, then speaking freely. Here's a biased ranking of practice methods:
  1. speaking in the presence of voices you want to sound like
  2. just talking in VC or in person
  3. doing a drill and reading a passage
  4. doing SOVTEs

# A typical plan
Below is a typical plan assuming an average masculine voice trained to be feminine. This isn't always accurate because everyone is different but it can give some direction to start. Adjustments will likely and should be made based on personal circumstances.

## Lower [vocal weight](/wiki/pages/vocal-weight) and raise pitch
- the recommendation is to start by lowering vocal weight. Getting to a higher pitch with lower weight makes a significant difference already
- using "awwww" as if talking to a cute puppy is a good behavioural trigger for getting light vocal weight
- avoid [breathiness](/wiki/pages/clarity/breathiness) or going too light, avoid [M2 / falsetto](/wiki/pages/other-resources/mechanisms) for now

## Raise [resonance](/wiki/pages/resonance) as needed
- people often raise their larynx (and thus, resonance) when going to a high pitch, so you might not need to do this step
- avoid [FVF](/wiki/pages/clarity/FVF) constriction (old man / old woman voice)
- when going out of an unvoiced slide, do so fluidly, avoid pauses that can let you reset to a lower larynx position
- clean the sound up before using it. Don't use a configuration that is rough, make it smooth first even at the cost of lowering resonance slightly

## Clean up the voice
If you're at this stage and you have any roughness in your voice, now's the time to sort it out. Going further will make it extremely difficult to unlearn later

- reduce [breathiness](/wiki/pages/clarity/breathiness)
- practice lighter onsets with glottal strikes
- learn [FVF](/wiki/pages/clarity/FVF) retraction
- identify sources of tension and eliminate them
- find or create your strategically lazy configuration

## Practice speech patterns
- find an [example](/wiki/pages/voice-examples) of a voice you like
- avoid emphasis with volume for feminine voices
- vary tempo
- intonation doesn't need to be super high, but it's worth practicing

## Get more [pitch range](/wiki/pages/pitch-range)
- at first this means just using the voice at a higher pitch sometimes to stretch your range. Fatigue is normal, but strain is to be avoided. If tension in neck persists for more than a few seconds after stopping speech, then you should rest and reevaluate your methods
- using [M2 and making it stronger](/wiki/pages/pitch-range/strong-m2) (sometimes called mix voice) is a good quick way to get tons of extra range
- practice intonating progressively higher

## Learn [belting](/wiki/pages/pitch-range/belting) to be able to shout
- know what pressed phonation / hyperaduction sounds like and DON'T DO IT.
- don't just do an ah vowel, do harder ones like eh
- slowly reduce weight at your highest note in order to go even higher (will probably break at first)

## Start [mimicry](/wiki/pages/microbehaviours/mimicry) and learn [microbehaviours](/wiki/pages/microbehaviours)
- find a clip of a voice such as from [voice examples](/wiki/pages/voice-examples) that is not outside your pitch or resonance range
- put a beep sound at the beginning for timing
- practice speaking over it as it plays and also listening and copying
