FVF or False Vocal Folds are the ventricular folds, just above the true vocal folds. When stressed, swallowing or holding our breath tightly, these constrict and close to protect the true folds. In older voices, we hear FVF more because the true folds have atrophied and over time lost the ability to function correctly, so the false folds pick up the lost closure.

The false folds should not be activated in normal speech.

There are commonly two problems associated with false fold constriction, FVF closure conflation and passive FVF constriction.

## FVF closure conflation
This is where the false folds are constricted when we try to add true fold closure. If left unchecked it can be very difficult to remedy.
There are signs of this that you can check on fortunately.

### Checking for FVF Closure Issues
1. hold your breath as lightly as possible.
2. breath out (you should notice a very slight pop)
  - if this pop is easily heard, you probably have FVF closure coming in
3. use glottal taps like we just did, and make the sound lighter and lighter, focusing on keeping a consistent stream of air. Don't use less air to make it softer, use more to challenge yourself to do it correctly

Good glottal taps:

## Passive FVF Constriction
This is where the voice constantly sound rough and hoarse. We can check for passive FVF in a few ways.

### Using light phonation
1. use a very light humming sound
2. make it lighter
3. is there a roughness or "rattle"?
  - yes -> probably constricted
  - no -> probably not constricted

Unconstricted hum:
