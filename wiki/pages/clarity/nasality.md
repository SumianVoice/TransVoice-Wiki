# Nasality
When a voice has too much air going through the nasal passage when speaking, we call it hypernasality or just nasality.

Nasality darkens the voice by making [formants](/wiki/pages/resonance/#formants) less highlighted.

## Checking Nasality
The main method of checking for nasality is to say a non nasal phrase (one without any N or M or NG sounds) with and then without the nose pinched. If there's a difference, there is nasality. The degree of nasality is how "honky" the sound is.

### Non Nasal Phrases
- Pick up the crate, be careful of the glass.
- Would you please take these three glasses to be washed below the tap.
- That black cat attacked the plastic bag.
- The elevator stopped for us at the third floor.
