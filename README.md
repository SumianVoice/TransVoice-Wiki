## Voice Resource Project
This project intends to provide as much actionable information about transvoice as possible, and act as a reference material.

Created 2022 03 09


## How to Contribute
It is best to make a pull request:
- Sign in to GitHub
- Fork the project and clone
- Make a new branch in that project and set the upstream to `https://github.com/SumianVoice/TransVoice-Wiki`
- Come back to this page `https://github.com/SumianVoice/TransVoice-Wiki` and open a pull request
- Describe what you're changing and why

Additions or changes should take these principles into account. Changes should do at least one of the following things:
- make voice resources more complete and accessible to the average viewer
- improve readability of pages for the public
- make code simpler and easier to make additions to
- fix errors or outdated information<br>
    _**OR**_
- make wiki pages more stylistically consistent

There are times when adding more information to a page will make it less accessible and more confusing, in which case we should ask if perhaps compartmentalising that topic into a new page such as under `https://wiki.sumianvoice.com/wiki/pages/various/` and linking to it would be better. Again, apply the above principles.


## GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SumianVoice/Voice-Art-Project/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### This header is really small

- Bulleted
- List
* you can use * as well

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

codeblock
with multiple lines
can be added with three `backticks` either side.

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

<button>You can also add HTML inline</button>
<p>...But most markdown **inside** will break</p>

You can also give elements classes like:
{: .someCSS-class .and-this-one-too }

Or <div class="something">

```

[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Running Locally

You can build and serve this page locally with Ruby like this:

```sh
gem install bundler jekyll
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SumianVoice/Voice-Art-Project/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
